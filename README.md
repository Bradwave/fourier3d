# Fourier 3D

An interactive visualization to explore signal decomposition and 3D frequency representations.

## How it works

**Craft your signal** by mixing wave components—think of them as musical notes. Use envelopes to shape how their volume evolves over time.

The **Fourier Transform** decomposes this signal, visualized as a stunning complex curve in 3D. The **Magnitude Plot** `|F(w)|` shows the strength of each frequency.

Check out the **Winding Plot** to see the math in action: your signal is wrapped around the origin at a specific frequency. The center of mass corresponds to the transform value!

## Features

- **Interactive Signal Construction**: add multiple sine waves with adjustable frequency and amplitude.
- **Real-time Visualization**: see changes instantly in the time domain, winding plot, and 3D transform view.
- **3D Fourier Transform**: rotate and explore the 3D representation of the fourier transform.
- **Audio Playback**: listen to the generated signals (frequency scaled for audibility).
